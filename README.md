INSIGHTS
Key insights from the analysis highlight significant findings regarding product preferences, sales trends, and city differences. The data shows a noticeable increase in sales during December, probably because of holiday celebrations.
-       Sales tend to peak in December, likely due to the holiday season.
-       Tuesdays bring in the most revenue, with $5 million, while Thursdays see the lowest, at $4.8 million.
-       The best-selling product is the AAA Batteries (4-pack), but despite its popularity with 31,000 units sold, its low price of $2.99 means it contributes less to overall revenue.
-       San Francisco leads in sales, with 45,000 orders, making up 24% of total orders, thanks in part to its preference for premium products like iPhones, Google Phones, MacBook Pro, and ThinkPad laptops. In contrast, Austin has only 10,000 orders, making up 5.33% of total orders.
-       Weekends bring in $9.84 million, about 28.52% of total revenue, while weekdays make $24.6 million, making up 71.48% of total revenue.
-   RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the findings, it's recommended to take advantage of the holiday season by creating specific marketing strategies and promotions. Additionally, understanding customer preferences better can help improve product offerings and increase sales.
